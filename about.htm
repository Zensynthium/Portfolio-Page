      <img id="guitar-image" src="images/me-playing-guitar.jpg" title="Look at that concentration!" alt="Me playing the guitar!">
      <p id="guitar-text">I was born and raised in Port Charlotte, FL, a really small retirement community before moving to Orlando in late 2019. I was always interested in science and technology and I knew that those were the fields that I had a passion for. I ended up programming as it was a way for me to be creative and hands on, and all I needed was a computer! I find myself always learning new things which is something I love.</p>

<div class="dark-sect">
  <p>My hobbies include but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programming (surprise!)</li>
    <li>Playing Basketball</li>
    <li>Playing the Guitar</li>
    <li>Video Games</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When I play basketball I prefer to play the gaurd position but I usually go into the role that is needed the most on the floor. My favorite video game at the moment is Smash Ultimate, but I love watching speedruns of all sorts of games as well. As far as playing and listening to music, my favorite genres are Alternative Rock, RnB, And Electronic. I enjoy trying new things all the time so this list will probably grow soon! Here's one of my favorite songs!

  <header><h2>Goals</h2></header>
  <p>One of my biggest goals in life is to make a strong positive impact on both the world as a whole and the individuals around me. Whether it's from building a responsive, dynamic, and scalable Web Application, or just from smiling at the person that's walking by to maybe brighten their day!</p>
